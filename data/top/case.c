	03155938:【OTG】T卡插入读卡器通过OTG线与手机连接，进行插拔操作，手机出现不识别U盘现象







	03154979:PMI8937平台，手机battery ID接触稍晚，手机不开机，请提供在SBL里re-detected ID的方法；
	{
		这个问题是工厂扣电池的时候如果bat id接触点扣的晚，即使后面再扣好还是不开机

		Hi,
		Below is an example for battery ID re-detection in LK, you can use it or refer to it and add related code in SBL.
		pm8x41.h
		+void battery_id_redetection();
		pm8x41.c
		+void battery_id_redetection()
		+{
		+uint8_t reg = 0x80;
		+pm8xxx_reg_write (2, 0x4150,0x80, 0); // set 0x80 to 0x4150
		+pm8xxx_reg_write (2, 0x4051,0, 0);//clear 0x4051
		+pm8xxx_reg_write (2, 0x4051,0x18, 0); //set 0x18 to 0x4051
		+pm8xxx_reg_write (2, 0x4051,0x19, 0); //set 0x19 to 0x4051
		+mdelay(1000);
		+pm8xxx_reg_write (2, 0x4051, 0,0); //clear 0x4051
		+pm8xxx_reg_write (2, 0x4150,0x80, 0); // clear 0x4150
		}
		android\bootable\bootloader\lk\target\msm89xx\init.c
		void target_init(void)
		{
		....
		+battery_id_redetection();
		+dprintf(CRITICAL, "add battery_id_redetection\n");
		}

		thanks

	03138699 :gsm模式下待机电流高(current is too high under gsm standby)
	{
		descripation:UE can reach bottom current, but it wakes up frequently so it causes averrage current very high.
		After turn on flight mode, the current is normal, so we doubt gsm settings maybe have some wrong.
