    + Tidy up obsolete / unneeded code.
    + Ensure CFLAGS, CXXFLAGS and LDFLAGS are properly exported to cmake. Add in 
      FFLAGS. -fvisibility=hidden and --as-needed should now work properly. The
      latter fixes a lot of dpkg-shlibdeps warnings.

    + Drop the call to octave-depends
  * Adjust the upstream code for working with Octave 3.6.1, by adding the

  * Force rebuild to fix dependency problems with ada development library
    and gnat-4.6 which make libplplot-ada0-dev uninstallable.
  * Add explicit dependency on gdc-v1 as package is not yet ready for gdc

  * New upstream release.
  * debian/patches/series: Remove patches from upstream which are included
    in the new release.
  * debian/control.in:
    + Add back in dependencies (rather than recommends) on the C++
      and fortran libraries. This does pull in extra libraries if you 
      only wish to develop with one language, but reverts to the old 
      behaviour (closes: #642715). 
  * debian/control.in, debian/libplplot-ada0.files,
    debian/libplplot-ada0-dev.files, debian/libplplot-dev, debian/rules,
    debian/README.Debian:
    + Split off ada development files from libplplot-dev package into new
      libplplot-ada0-dev package. Move .ali files from libplplot-ada into
      libplplot-ada0-dev package as per Debian Ada policy. Add explicit
      dependency on ada-compiler, gnat and gnat-4.6 as per policy.
      (closes: #644105, #644110, #644112)

    + Update to reflect changes in upstream ChangeLog file name. 
    + Tidy up some old comments.
    + Change from calling ctest to using "make test_noninteractive"
      to run the tests. Also include .NOTPARALLEL target to prevent the 
      rules makefile being parallelised. Instead pass -j options to the
      plplot make files. This allows parallel builds to work correctly.
    + Fix a temporary permissions problem with test script in the 5.9.8
      tarball.
    + Fix dependency generation for octave package.
    + Fix python build so that the installed example Makefiles are

    allow use of the plplot API in qt applications. 
  * debian/control.in:

      Java libraries do not need to depend on a java runtime. Fixes 
      lintian warning.
    + Tidy up section / priority headers for the packages.
  * debian/patches/series, debian/patches/08_oct_perms.diff, 
    debian/patches/09_qt_nodisplay.diff,

      (fixes lintian error). 
    + Add patch from upstream to enable non-interactive qt devices to work
      even if DISPLAY is not set (prevents error when running tests on a 
      buildd / using pbuilder). 
    + Add new upstream patch to remove spurious chmod commands from test 
      scripts. This ensures the installed examples will work as expected.
    + Add new upstream patch to change the install location for OCaml
      libraries to remove the OCaml version (as per Debian OCaml practice)
      and to remove the execute permissions for the stublibs.
    + Add temporary workaround from upstream to prevent crash on exit with
      the qt driver and Qt-4.7.3.
  * debian/copyright: Make explicit that the license is LGPL-2 (fixes
    lintian warning). Update consistent with upstream copyright file.
  * debian/control.in, debian/rules, debian/libqsastime0.files, 
    debian/libqsastime-dev.file:
    Split libqsastime off into separate library and devel packages.
  * debian/libplplot-dev.files, debian/libplplot-fortran9.files:
    Move fortran .h and .mod files to the libplplot-dev package as these
    are required for compiling fortran with plplot and not for runtime.
  * debian/plplot-tcl-dev.lintian-overrides: Add lintian override for
    informational warning about interpreter path not being absolute.
  * debian/rules: Add -fvisibility=hidden to CFLAGS and -Wl,--as-needed
    to LD_FLAGS to only export required symbols and prevent linking in
    unnecessary libraries. Reduces the dependency requirements, 
    particularly for the drivers.

    version.
  * debian/patches/17_fix_cmap_support.diff, debian/patches/series: Add
    bug fix patch from upstream to fix cmap palette support. This fixes

      transition from g77 to gfortran.  Also, drop the unnecessary
      build-dependencies on blas, atlas, and lapack, since they are pulled
      in by octave3.0.
  * Add dpatches:

    only used in building the documentation. Reduces package dependencies
    for autobuilders.

    - Call the dh_movefiles command only after everything has been

pplplot (5.3.1-9) unstable; urgency=low

  * Recompiled against latest version of libc6.  PLplot does not cause
    Octave to crash anymore (closes: #351734).

 -- Rafael Laboissiere <rafael@debian.org>  Wed,  8 Mar 2006 11:27:30 +0100

plplot (5.3.1-8) unstable; urgency=low

  * Due to the gnome1 -> gnome2 transition in sid, the plplot9-driver-gnome
    package is removed.  The experimental release of plplot (5.5.3)
    already contains the gcw driver, which replaces the gnome driver.

 -- Rafael Laboissiere <rafael@debian.org>  Tue, 27 Sep 2005 09:34:01 +0200

plplot (5.3.1-7) unstable; urgency=low

  * Build-depends on gfortran instead of g77.  This should get around a
    build failure on the ia64 architecture.

 -- Rafael Laboissiere <rafael@debian.org>  Tue, 27 Sep 2005 00:11:33 +0200

plplot (5.3.1-6) unstable; urgency=low

  * This version will *_really_* complete the C++ ABI transition.  I forgot
    to do it for the libplplot-c++9 package, which is now called
    libplplot-c++9c2.  Most of the changes come from the Ubuntu patch
    (thanks to Stephan Hermann <sh@sourcecode.de>):

    + debian/control: adjusted packagename, conflicts/replaces, dependencies
    + debian/rules: adjusted packagename
    + debian/libplplot-c++9c2.files: renamed and edited to new packagename

 -- Rafael Laboissiere <rafael@debian.org>  Sun, 18 Sep 2005 14:51:55 +0200

plplot (5.3.1-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * First build with gcc/g++ 4.0.  This should complete the C++ ABI
    transition for the octave-plplot package (closes: #328198).

  * debian/rules: Avoid compilation problem of unrecognized type
    '__builtin_va_list' when building the Octave binding
    (closes: #274359).  I am fixing this bug using the hack of setting the
    CC variable of the Makefile, instead applying the patch suggested by
    Kaare Hviid <ukh_at_id.cbs.dk>, because otherwise I would have to run
    automake/libtool/autoconf to build the package. Lame, But It Works (TM).

  * debian/control: Upgraded Standards-Version to 3.6.2 (no changes needed).

  * debian/copyright: New FSF address.

  * debian/patches/50_simplelist-in-man-page.dpatch: Added patch to fix
    processing of plcol0.3plplot man page.

 -- Rafael Laboissiere <rafael@debian.org>  Fri, 16 Sep 2005 22:46:28 +0200

plplot (5.5.3-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New uspstream release (development branch, hence the upload to
    experimental).
  * The plplot9-driver-gnome package is replaced by plplot9-driver-gnome2,
    which contain the new gcw driver and the liplplpotgnome2 libary.
  * The new package python-plplot-gnome2 contains the glue code for using
    libplplotgnome2 with Python.

 -- Rafael Laboissiere <rafael@debian.org>  Tue,  3 May 2005 09:15:10 +0200

plplot (5.3.1-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/rules: Added --with-freefont option to configure
  * debian/control:
    - plplot9-driver-gd recommends now the ttf-freefont package
    - libplplot-dev depends on libplplot-c++9, avoiding broken link
      /usr/lib/libplplotcxxd.so (closes: #303830)

 -- Rafael Laboissiere <rafael@debian.org>  Sat,  9 Apr 2005 11:03:11 +0200

plplot (5.3.1-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Rebuild against Octave 2.1.66
  * debian/control:
    - Build-depends on octave2.1-headers (>= 2.1.65)
    - Fixed typo in description of libcsiro0 package (closes: #284381)
    - Made the libplplot9 package suggest all the driver packages,
      including plplot-tcl, which contains the Tk driver (closes: #285193)
    - Droped several dependencies on libplplot9 (= ${Source-Version}),
      which were causing lintian to complain
  * debian-rules:
    - Include defs.make and use octave-depends command
    - Droped manual setting of octave-plplot.substvars
    - Use OCTDIR to install plplot_octave.oct

 -- Rafael Laboissiere <rafael@debian.org>  Fri, 25 Feb 2005 13:36:26 +0100

plplot (5.3.1-2) unstable; urgency=low

   * Rebuilt against Octave 2.1.64.

 -- Rafael Laboissiere <rafael@debian.org>  Sat,  4 Dec 2004 16:57:04 +0100

plplot (5.3.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.

 -- Rafael Laboissiere <rafael@debian.org>  Fri, 25 Jun 2004 10:15:00 +0200

plplot (5.3.0.rc2.5.3.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * debian/rules: Removed old code for architecture-specific exclusion of
    the octave-plplot package.
  * debian/struct_contain.m: Removed this file, since it has been
    included upstream.

 -- Rafael Laboissiere <rafael@debian.org>  Fri, 18 Jun 2004 07:52:54 +0200

plplot (5.3.0.rc1.5.3.1-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/control:  Make the build-dependencies on atlas/lapack specific
    to the arm and m68k architectures.

 -- Rafael Laboissiere <rafael@debian.org>  Thu, 17 Jun 2004 16:13:55 +0200

plplot (5.3.0.rc1.5.3.1-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/control:  Refine the build-dependencies on atlas/lapack to make
    the package build from source on m68k and arm.

 -- Rafael Laboissiere <rafael@debian.org>  Thu, 17 Jun 2004 13:12:04 +0200

plplot (5.3.0.rc1.5.3.1-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/control: Added build-dependency on atlas3-base-dev.  For some
    obscure reason, plplot is FTBFS on the architectures ia64, s390,
    sparc, powerpc, hppa, and mipsel, because neither atlas3-base-dev nor
    lapack3-dev are automatically installed.  This should be the case, due
    to the build-dependency on octave2.1.-headers.  I will keep
    atlas3-base-dev in Build-Depends until the problem is fixed.

 -- Rafael Laboissiere <rafael@debian.org>  Thu, 17 Jun 2004 10:51:07 +0200

plplot (5.3.0.rc1.5.3.1-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/control: Added dependency on libplplot3-dev to libplplot-dev.

 -- Rafael Laboissiere <rafael@debian.org>  Wed, 16 Jun 2004 17:46:23 +0200

plplot (5.3.0.rc1.5.3.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * debian/patches: Removed all Octave patches, since they have been
    applied upstream.

 -- Rafael Laboissiere <rafael@debian.org>  Mon, 14 Jun 2004 20:40:46 +0200

plplot (5.3.0.cvs.20040520-0.sarge.2) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/control: Add dpendencies to libplplot9 (= ${Source-Version}),
    to all packages besides libplplot9 itself.  The package is now Lintian
    clean.

 -- Rafael Laboissiere <rafael@debian.org>  Mon, 31 May 2004 23:36:20 +0200

plplot (5.3.0.cvs.20040520-0.sarge.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Built for Debian testing (a.k.a. sarge).

plplot (5.3.0.cvs.20040520-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New CVS tarball upstream release

plplot (5.3.0.cvs.20040517-0.sarge.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Built for Debian testing (a.k.a. sarge).

plplot (5.3.0.cvs.20040517-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New CVS tarball upstream release.

 -- Rafael Laboissiere <rafael@debian.org>  Mon, 17 May 2004 10:05:37 +0200

plplot (5.3.0.cvs.20040430-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/patches/octave-2.1.53-demos.dpatch: Added patches for Octave
    demos x13c.m, x14c.m, and x17c.m.  The whole set of examples for
    the Octave bindings work now with Octave version 2.1.57.
  * debian/patches/warn-empty-list-elements.dpatch: Added patches for
    shade.m and __pl_contour.m.  The demos p*.m work now with Octave
    version 2.1.57 (except demos p6.m, p17.m, and p20.m).
  * debian/rules (install-stamp): Install the file
    debian/struct_contains.m before the calls to dh_movefiles, such that
    struct_contains.m really goes into the octave-plplot package.

 -- Rafael Laboissiere <rafael@debian.org>  Tue, 11 May 2004 10:08:11 +0200

plplot (5.3.0.cvs.20040430-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/patches/warn-empty-list-elements.dpatch,
    debian/patches/warn-fortran-indexing.dpatch: Added patches for making
    the Octave binding working with Octave 2.1.57.
  * debian/struct_contains.m: New file which override Octave's one when
    toggle_plplot_use is issued.
  * debian/rules: Install debian/struct_contains.m in
    /usr/share/plplot_octave.

 -- Rafael Laboissiere <rafael@debian.org>  Sat,  8 May 2004 19:22:58 +0200

plplot (5.3.0.cvs.20040430-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/control:
    - Removed build-dependency on g++-3.3 | g++-3.2, since g++ is a
      build-essential package (closes: #244007).
    - Use build-dependencies on libx11-dev, libxext-dev, and libxi-dev
      instead of on xlibs-dev, since this later is now a transition
      package (after the XFree86 4.3.0 package reorganization in Debian).
  * Build in unstable, so that the octave-plplot package gets
    the right dependency on libhdf5 (closes: #246297).

 -- Rafael Laboissiere <rafael@debian.org>  Sat,  8 May 2004 12:15:29 +0200

plplot (5.3.0.cvs.20040324-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Patched the configure script to avoid stderr messages to interfere with
    the Octave configuration.  This may fix the recurrent buildd failures
    on the m68k architecture.

 -- Rafael Laboissiere <rafael@debian.org>  Wed, 31 Mar 2004 21:23:06 +0200

plplot (5.3.0.cvs.20040324-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New cvs snapshot upstream release.
  * debian/control: Removed build-conflict on f2c and fort77.  Added
    fort77 build-dependency for the m68k architecture.  This should fix
    the problem of building from source for m68k, since mkoctfile
    apparently needs the f2c library for linking *.oct files on that
    architecture.

 -- Rafael Laboissiere <rafael@debian.org>  Thu, 25 Mar 2004 07:15:54 +0100

plplot (5.3.0.cvs.20040303-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New cvs snapshot upstream release.
  * Reorganization of the packages to avoid potential problems with future
    upgradings of the PLplot libary soversion.  Since libplplotcxxd,
    libcsirocsa, and libcsironn have different soversion numbers
    upstream, they are separated from the main libplplot9.
  * debian/control:
    - In the description of libplplot9, updated contents of package.
    - libplplot-c++9: New package.
    - libcsiro0: New package.
  * debian/libplplot-c++9.files: New file.
  * debian/libcsiro.files: New file.
  * debian/rules: create symlinks for /usr/share/doc/lib{plplot-c++9,csiro}
    to /usr/share/doc/libplplot9.

 -- Rafael Laboissiere <rafael@debian.org>  Wed, 10 Mar 2004 23:39:13 +0100

plplot (5.3.0-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Remove the programs in /usr/bin from the libplplot9 package and put
    them into the new package plplot-bin.  This will avoid future
    conflicts when the soversion of the library will be incremented.

 -- Rafael Laboissiere <rafael@debian.org>  Sat, 28 Feb 2004 14:24:56 +0100

plplot (5.3.0-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/control: Made libplplot9 conflict with the old plplot package
    (<< 5).  This allows a smooth upgrade from stable to testing/unstable
    by avoiding the overwriting of the file /usr/bin/pltek
    (closes: #235252).

 -- Rafael Laboissiere <rafael@debian.org>  Sat, 28 Feb 2004 08:24:33 +0100

plplot (5.3.0-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Get Octave bindings to work with octave2.1-2.1.53, the version
    available in unstable.  Using dpatch for that.
  * debian/rules:
    - Include dpatch.make.
    - Targets build and clean depend on patch and unpatch, respectively.
  * debian/control:
    - Build-Depends on dpatch.
    - Drop alternative build-dependency to octave2.0-headers and force
      versioned dependency on octave2.1-headers (>= 2.1.54-2)

 -- Rafael Laboissiere <rafael@debian.org>  Thu, 19 Feb 2004 21:23:50 +0100

plplot (5.3.0-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/control: Removed build-dependency on libhdf5-serial-dev, since
    it will be included in the build-dependencies of octave2.1-headers
    (version 2.1.53-3).

 -- Rafael Laboissiere <rafael@debian.org>  Tue,  3 Feb 2004 15:02:04 +0100

plplot (5.3.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.

 -- Rafael Laboissiere <rafael@debian.org>  Thu, 29 Jan 2004 16:37:54 +0100

plplot (5.2.1.rc2.5.3.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Second release candiate tarball for version 5.3.0.
  * debian/control: Removed most of the Conflicts/Replaces/Provides
    fields, since they where legacies from the libplplot5 packages.  The
    libplplot9 and libplplot5 still cannot co-exist (although this is
    only of theoretical interest, since there are no other packages in
    Debian that depend on libplplot5).

 -- Rafael Laboissiere <rafael@debian.org>  Thu, 22 Jan 2004 23:13:45 +0100

plplot (5.2.1.rc1.5.3.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New cvs snapshot upstream release (first release candidate for 5.3.0
    release)

 -- Rafael Laboissiere <rafael@debian.org>  Sun, 18 Jan 2004 11:43:27 +0100

plplot (5.2.1.cvs.20040115-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * scripts/get-dependency-libs.sh: Applied upstream CVS patch for finding
    library files in .libs directories in the build tree.

 -- Rafael Laboissiere <rafael@debian.org>  Thu, 15 Jan 2004 10:16:32 +0100

plplot (5.2.1.cvs.20040115-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * bindings/octave/PLplot/toggle_plplot_use.m,
    bindings/octave/PLplot/plplot_octave_path.m.in:
      Applied patch from upstream CVS to fix problems related to Octave
      2.1.52.

 -- Rafael Laboissiere <rafael@debian.org>  Thu, 15 Jan 2004 09:31:21 +0100

plplot (5.2.1.cvs.20040115-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/control:
    - Made Build-Conflicts on libplplot5 unversioned.
    - Removed from Build-Depends and Build-Conflicts the m68k specificities
      related to g77, fort77, and f2c.  This is a try to get around a
      FTBFS on the m68k architecture.  Also, requires g++-3.3 | g++-3.2
      instead of only g++-3.2.

 -- Rafael Laboissiere <rafael@debian.org>  Thu, 15 Jan 2004 06:30:51 +0100

plplot (5.2.1.cvs.20040104-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/control: Added pkg-config to build-dependencies and to
    libplplot-dev Recommends:.
  * debian/rules:
    - Added option --with-pkg-config to configure command.
    - Set environment variable PKG_CONFIG_ENV to " " when calling
      condfigure.  This allows a cleaner line when launching make fro
      the installed examples/* directories, since setting PKG_CONFIG_PATH is
      not necessary in Debian.

 -- Rafael Laboissiere <rafael@debian.org>  Sat,  3 Jan 2004 20:24:53 +0100

plplot (5.2.1.cvs.20031231-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New cvs snapshot upstream release
  * debian/control: Changed section of packages libplplot9,
    plplot9-driver-gd, plplot9-driver-gnome, and plplot9-driver-xwin to
    libs (was math before) in order to comply with overrides of
    debian-installer.
  * debian/plplot-tcl.files: Include directories and files
    usr/share/plplot*/*tcl

 -- Rafael Laboissiere <rafael@debian.org>  Wed, 31 Dec 2003 14:12:22 +0100

plplot (5.2.1.cvs.20031228-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New cvs snapshot upstream release

plplot (5.2.1.cvs.20031227-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New cvs snapshot upstream release.

plplot (5.2.1.cvs.20031226-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New cvs snapshot upstream release.

 -- Rafael Laboissiere <rafael@debian.org>  Fri, 26 Dec 2003 16:48:05 +0100

plplot (5.2.1.cvs.20031030-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/rules: Call configure with --enable-static, such that the
    lib*.a files will be present in the *-dev packages (closes: #224550).
  * debian/control: Changed architecture of packages libplplot-dev and
    plplot-tcl-dev from "all" to "any", because of the *.a files included.

 -- Rafael Laboissiere <rafael@debian.org>  Sat, 20 Dec 2003 17:48:52 +0100

plplot (5.2.1.cvs.20031030-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Preparation for the next upstream version, which changed the soversion
    of the PLplot library.  Changed all the references to libplplot5 to
    libplplot9.  Affected files:
    - debian/control
    - debian/libplplot-dev.files
    - debian/octave-plplot.files
    - debian/plplot-doc.doc-base
    - debian/plplot-doc.files
    - debian/plplot-tcl-dev.files
    - debian/python-plplot.files
    - debian/rules
    - debian/libplplot9.README.Debian (new)
    - debian/libplplot9.files (new)
  * In order to avoid backward incompatibilities with the release of
    libplplot9, the driver module packages have now versioned names:
    - plplot9-driver-gd
    - plplot9-driver-xwin
    - plplot9-driver-gnome

 -- Rafael Laboissiere <rafael@debian.org>  Thu, 30 Oct 2003 09:37:15 +0100

plplot (5.2.1.cvs.20031027-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/rules:
    - Added symlinks /usr/lib/lib{nn,csa}.so.0, such that this release of
      the libplplot5 package does not break binary compatiblity with previous
      released versions of PLplot (closes: #217895).  This is an interim
      solution.  Probably, the upstream authors will have to change the
      soversion or revert the changing of names of the libscsiro{nn,csa}
      libraries in order to get the problem cleanly fixed.
    - Call configure with --disable-java, since enable_java has been made
      the default in the upstream configure.ac.

 -- Rafael Laboissiere <rafael@debian.org>  Tue, 28 Oct 2003 13:45:21 +0100

plplot (5.2.1.cvs.20031027-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/libplplot-dev.files: Added README.pkg-config file.
  * debian/libplplot5.README.Debian: Fixed typos.

 -- Rafael Laboissiere <rafael@debian.org>  Mon, 27 Oct 2003 11:44:16 +0100

plplot (5.2.1.cvs.20031027-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New CVS snapshot upstream release.  This release is actually quite
    close to the latest Debian 5.2.1-21, since I have been tracking CVS
    developments since the upstream release 5.2.1.  One of biggest
    advantages of this move is the enourmous reduction in the size of the
    diff.gz file:

      du -b plplot*diff*
      2686036 ../plplot_5.2.1-21.diff.gz
      10198   ../plplot_5.2.1.cvs.20031027-1.diff.gz

    This huge difference is due to the patched documentation file and the
    necessity of an uuencoded file for the Debian packages.

  * debian/rules: Removed all manipulations (targets "build" and
    "clean") related to the plplot-5.2.1-new-doc.tar.gz.uu file, which is
    not included in the source package anymore.  Also, added flag -k to
    make distclean.

  * debian/control: Removed build-dependency on sharutils.

  * debian/libplplot5.README.Debian: Added note about pkg-config support.

 -- Rafael Laboissiere <rafael@debian.org>  Mon, 27 Oct 2003 09:50:09 +0100

plplot (5.2.1-21) unstable; urgency=low

  * sysloc.in: Applied patch from upstream CVS that assigns an unversioned
    path to OCTAVE_OCT_DIR.
  * debian/rules:
    - Loosen the restriction on the Octave version dependency, now that
      OCTAVE_OCT_DIR is unversioned.
    - Configure with --with-pthreads, such that the xwin driver refreshes
      the plot when the window is moved or re-exposed.

 -- Rafael Laboissiere <rafael@debian.org>  Mon, 20 Oct 2003 10:42:55 +0200

plplot (5.2.1-20) unstable; urgency=low

  * Following a suggestion of Matthias Klose <doko@cs.tu-berlin.de>, the
    libltdl library shipped with the upstream sources is not compiled
    anymore as a convenience library:
    - Patched configure.ac and Makefile.am from upstream CVS. The
      configure option --with-ltdlsystem is now implemented, which allows
      the use of the installed libltdl library.
    - debian/control: Build-depends on libltdl3-dev.
    - debian/rules: Call configure with option --with-ltdlsystem.
  * debian/control:
    - Fixed description of libplplot-dev package.
    - Bumped the build-dependency on debhelper to version 4.1.67, since we
      are using dh_python (thanks again to Matthias Klose for pointing
      this out).

 -- Rafael Laboissiere <rafael@debian.org>  Fri, 17 Oct 2003 08:25:49 +0200

plplot (5.2.1-19) unstable; urgency=low

  * configure.ac: Added upstream patch from the CVS repository to avoid

plplot (5.2.1-18) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/rules: Use dh_python to correctly generate python version
    dependencies in debian/python-plplot.substvars.  This will guarantee
    clean upgrades (closes: #207314).
  * Regenerated configuration files with latest versions of the autotools in
    Debian sid (automake 1.7.7 and libtool 1.5).

 -- Rafael Laboissiere <rafael@debian.org>  Mon, 15 Sep 2003 10:21:09 +0200

plplot (5.2.1-17) unstable; urgency=low

  * Rebuilt against the new python2.3-dev itcl/itk 3.2 and iwidgets4
    packages.
  * debian/control:
    - Bumped Standards-Version to 3.6.1.
    - Bumped build-dependencies to python2.3, itcl3, and itk3.
    - plplot-tcl depends now on iwidgets4.
  * sysloc.in, configure.ac: Using patched version from CVS upstream with
    fixes in the Python configuration and in the list of include
    directories to find files itcl.h and itk.h.
  * Used new CVS upstream version of the documentation files with
    legacy license statement removed.  A uuencoded tarball
    debian/plplot-5.2.1-new-do.tar.gz.uu is included, which forced the
    inclusion of sharutils in Build-Depends.  Code have been added to
    debian/rules to unpack the new files in this tarball. The plplot-doc
    package is now DFSG compliant (closes: #202761).
  * utils/plrender.c: Patched from CVS upstream.  From the commit log:
    Comment out call to plSetInternalOpt which uses the tcl_cmd option
    that has been disabled in plargs.c.  This fix solves the plrender
    memory management problems and the crashes associated with plrender
    and device tk.

 -- Rafael Laboissiere <rafael@debian.org>  Mon, 25 Aug 2003 02:01:19 +0200

plplot (5.2.1-16) unstable; urgency=low

  * Disallow Build-Conflicts on f2c and fort77 for m68k.

 -- Rafael Laboissiere <rafael@debian.org>  Wed,  9 Jul 2003 23:29:46 +0200

plplot (5.2.1-15) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added build-dependency on fort77 for the m68k to match the
    build-dependencies of the octave2.1_2.1.50-2 package.

 -- Rafael Laboissiere <rafael@debian.org>  Tue,  8 Jul 2003 02:00:34 +0200

plplot (5.2.1-14) unstable; urgency=low

  * Rebuilt with new octave2.1 package (2.1.50-1), such that the
    octave-plplot has the correct dependencies in unstable.

 -- Rafael Laboissiere <rafael@debian.org>  Thu,  3 Jul 2003 11:01:24 +0200

plplot (5.2.1-13) unstable; urgency=low

  * Use new upstream version of sysloc.in, with better
    AC_MSG_CHECKING/AC_MSG_RESULT settings for the Octave checks.  This
    will help in interpreting the buildd logs for some architectures for
    which the building is failing.
  * debian/control: Added build-dependency on g++-3.2, since its path is
    hardcoded in /usr/bin/mkoctfile for some architectures.

 -- Rafael Laboissiere <rafael@debian.org>  Tue,  3 Jun 2003 23:20:16 +0200

plplot (5.2.1-12) unstable; urgency=low

  * Enable building of octave-plplot for all architectures.  The octave2.1
    package (version 2.1.49-3*) is working now in all 11 architectures of
    Debian sarge.  Hopefully, PLplot will now make its way into testing.

 -- Rafael Laboissiere <rafael@debian.org>  Tue,  3 Jun 2003 10:49:11 +0200

plplot (5.2.1-11) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/control: Added arm to the list of excluded architectures of
    package octave2.*-header in Build-Depends.
  * debian/rules: Exclude building of Octave bindings for the arm
    architecture.
  * (N.B.: I am currently excluding the building of the octave-plplot for
    four architectures: hppa, powerpc, m68k, and arm.  I will revisit this
    decision later when octave2.1 will work again for these
    architectures.

 -- Rafael Laboissiere <rafael@debian.org>  Thu, 22 May 2003 22:50:37 +0200

plplot (5.2.1-10) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/control: Added m68k to the list of excluded architectures of
    package octave2.*-header in Build-Depends.  Added dependency on
    python-numeric to package python-plplot.
  * debian/rules: Exclude building of Octave bindings for m68k
    architecture.

 -- Rafael Laboissiere <rafael@debian.org>  Thu, 22 May 2003 11:26:52 +0200

plplot (5.2.1-9) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/control: Restored "Architecture: any" for the octave-plplot
    package.  Excluded build-dependencies on octave for the hppa and
    powerpc architectures.

 -- Rafael Laboissiere <rafael@debian.org>  Mon, 12 May 2003 18:30:23 +0200

plplot (5.2.1-8) unstable; urgency=low

  * Rebuilt using octave 2.1.48.

 -- Rafael Laboissiere <rafael@debian.org>  Thu,  8 May 2003 14:33:18 +0200

plplot (5.2.1-7) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/rules: Correctly changed some rule dependencies to *-stamp,
    since the config target was being unnecessarily executed twice during
    the package building.

 -- Rafael Laboissiere <rafael@debian.org>  Wed,  7 May 2003 08:42:27 +0200

plplot (5.2.1-6) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/rules: Added conditional exclusion of the octave-plplot package
    to the dh_gencontrol and dh_builddeb commands.

 -- Rafael Laboissiere <rafael@debian.org>  Tue,  6 May 2003 21:29:56 +0200

plplot (5.2.1-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/rules: Added variable octave_mvf to control exclusion of
    package octave-plplot in dh_movefiles command.

 -- Rafael Laboissiere <rafael@debian.org>  Tue,  6 May 2003 16:59:52 +0200

plplot (5.2.1-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Exclude architectures hppa and powerpc from the building of the
    octave-plplot package (in debian/control).  There are now variables
    octave_cfg and octave_pkg in debian/rules to control this.
  * debian/control: Changed description to comply with the Best Packaging
    Practices of the Debian Developer's Reference.

 -- Rafael Laboissiere <rafael@debian.org>  Tue,  6 May 2003 11:03:40 +0200

plplot (5.2.1-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed AC_MSG_CHECKING for the Octave prefix in sysloc.in (upstream
    file).  Also, added the lacking file doc/docbook/docbook.m4 from
    upstream CVS and regenerated configure with autoconf.
  * debian/rules: In clean rule, "make distclean" instead of "make clean".
  * Copied new top-level Makefile.am and Makefile.in from upstream CVS.

 -- Rafael Laboissiere <rafael@debian.org>  Sat,  3 May 2003 08:54:18 +0200

plplot (5.2.1-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/control: Removed the explicit build-dependencies on libpng-dev,
    libjpeg-dev, and libfreetype-dev, since they are declared as
    dependencies of libgd2-dev.  This is an attempt to fix the libpng
    incompatibility between libgd2-dev and libgnome-dev.  Also, fixed a typo
    in the Build-Conflicts field.

  * debian/rules: Remove config.sub and config.guess in clean rule.

 -- Rafael Laboissiere <rafael@debian.org>  Tue, 29 Apr 2003 13:42:34 +0200

plplot (5.2.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New stable upstream release.
  * debian/control: Removed warnings about experimental aspect of the
    packages in the Description fields (closes: #189499).

 -- Rafael Laboissiere <rafael@debian.org>  Sun, 20 Apr 2003 23:18:09 +0200

plplot (5.2.0.cvs.20030415-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Built with new CVS sources.

 -- Rafael Laboissiere <rafael@debian.org>  Sun, 13 Apr 2003 23:03:01 +0200

plplot (5.2.0.cvs.20030411-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Built with new CVS sources.

 -- Rafael Laboissiere <rafael@debian.org>  Fri, 11 Apr 2003 09:51:08 +0200

plplot (5.2.0.cvs.20030403-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Built with new CVS sources.
  * Added build depends on autotools-dev and let debian/rules update
    config.sub and config.guess.

 -- Rafael Laboissiere <rafael@debian.org>  Thu,  3 Apr 2003 16:52:17 +0200

plplot (5.2.0.cvs.20030401-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Built with new CVS sources.
  * debian/control: Added build-dependency on matwrap.  Changed sections of
    libplplot-dev and python-plplot to libdevel and python.

 -- Rafael Laboissiere <rafael@debian.org>  Mon, 31 Mar 2003 21:33:38 +0200

plplot (5.2.0.cvs.20030325-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Built with new CVS sources: The problem with the non-numerical version
    number in pkgIndex.tcl has been fixed (closes: #185677).

 -- Rafael Laboissiere <rafael@debian.org>  Tue, 25 Mar 2003 15:34:25 +0100

plplot (5.2.0.cvs.20030320-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Built with new CVS sources: configure has now new options for
    controlling configuration and building of the Docbook documentation.
    This should generated less warning messages in the autobuilders.
  * debian/control: Bumped Standards-Version to 3.5.9.  Added
    libxml-parser-perl and libxml-dom-perl to Build-Depends, since these
    Perl modules are needed for the Octave bindings.

 -- Rafael Laboissiere <rafael@debian.org>  Thu, 20 Mar 2003 09:27:35 +0100

plplot (5.2.0.cvs.20030319-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Built with new CVS sources: Since my last upload, there has been only
    improvements in the Octave bindings.
  * debian/control: Set Priority: extra for plplot-tcl-dev, such that
    debcheck will not complain.  Also, changed the order of
    octave2.1-headers and octave2.0-headers in Build-Depends.  This will
    probably make the autobuilders to install the more recent version of
    Octave and fix the build problems.

 -- Rafael Laboissiere <rafael@debian.org>  Wed, 19 Mar 2003 08:31:30 +0100

plplot (5.2.0.cvs.20030317-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Built with new CVS sources: fixes in the Octave bindings and in the
    Docbook documentation.  The configure script does not choke anymore if
    the swig program is not available (closes: #184694, closes: #183947).
  * Fixed the mess with the Python version.  Now, both Python 2.1 and 2.2
    are accepted and the dependency field of package python-plplot is
    obtained through the substvar ${python:Depends}, which is set in the
    rule config of debian/rules.
  * PLplot installs now the .oct file in a versioned directory.  The
    correct dependency of octave-plplot is now obtained through the
    substvar ${octave:Depends (closes: #183913).
  * debian/control:
      - Added dependencies on libqhull-dev and libfreetype6-dev to
        libplplot-dev, such that the examples will compile.
      - Removed build-dependency to xlib6g-dev.
  * debian/rules added --enable-smart-ac-output option to configure, to
    avoid needless recompilation of the documentation.
  * Moved the plplot_libtool script from libplplot5 into libplplot-dev.
  * The ntk driver is now correctly put in the plplot-tcl package, instead
    of libplplot5.  This was forcing the erroneous dependency of
    libplplot5 on Tcl/Tk 8.3.  Shame on me!
  * debian/control: Added build-dependencies to libpng3-dev and
    libjpeg62-dev, such that plplot-gd is built correctly.

 -- Rafael Laboissiere <rafael@debian.org>  Sun, 16 Mar 2003 15:09:45 +0100

plplot (5.2.0.cvs.20030307-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Built with new CVS sources: there are slight improvements in the Octave
    bindings, regarding the user function toggle_plplot_use.
  * debian/control:
      - Changed some Priority and Section headers to match the override
        file in the Debian repository, such that the package upload will
        be accepted (hopefully).
      - Added m4 to Build-Depends.

 -- Rafael Laboissiere <rafael@debian.org>  Fri,  7 Mar 2003 09:47:22 +0100

plplot (5.2.0.cvs.20030306-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Built with new CVS sources:
      - The new API plgriddata has been added, as well as the nn and csa
        libraries.
      - The pkg-config files changed place.
      - Xwin driver is now Pthreaded.
      - Patch to plsym.c allowing vertical text in the bottom and top axes.
  * debian/rules: Removing debian/files for lintian cleanness.  After
    installation, the dvi form of the documentation is deleted.
  * debian/plplot-doc.files: Added the .ps.gz documentation file.
  * debian/control: For plplot-doc, added Conlicts: relationship to
    libplplot5, since the .ps.gz have been moved.  Improved description
    for the plplot-doc package.

 -- Rafael Laboissiere <rafael@debian.org>  Wed,  5 Mar 2003 14:47:07 +0100

plplot (5.2.0.cvs.20030301-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Built with new CVS sources.  Fixed gnome driver, which was plotting
    extraneous text on the canvas.  Also, the Octave initalization file is
    fixed now, and use_plplot really works.
  * debian/libplplot-dev.files: Added /usr/lib/pkgconfig dir.
  * debian/control: Removed optional dependencies on octave2.0, since the
    octave-plplot package is built for Octave 2.1 and the .oct file will not
    work with 2.0.

 -- Rafael Laboissiere <rafael@debian.org>  Fri, 28 Feb 2003 19:40:23 +0100

plplot (5.2.0.cvs.20030227-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * This is the first release of this cvs snapshot series to the Debian
    unstable repository (closes: #101264).
  * A big thanks to David Schleef, who has acted as interim maintainer
    (and made a great job) while I have been unavailable.
  * Many bugs that have been around for ages are fixed in this
    release:
    - The plplot-tcl package depends on tcl8.3 and tk8.3 (closes: #117186).
    - The octave-plplot package is totally new and has been integrated
      into the upstream sources of PLplot (closes: #91308).  Octave
      bindings are working correctly now (closes: #158446).  In
      particular, the plplot_octave-demo.m script works fine (closes: #69710).
    - use_plplot.m works correctly now (closes: #181875, closes: #74908),
      and all the files are found in the LOADPATH of Octave (closes: #179224).
    - Python examples should run now, thanks to the new dynamic drivers
      scheme (closes: #92150).
    - All PLplot manpages have proper whatis entries nows (closes: #100867).
    - Dependences on tk8.3-dev have been dropped (closes: #167412).
    - Build failure on sparc, due to bad c++ command line options should
      be fixed now (it was already in David's NMU, closes: #86880).
    - Packages should be fully installable in unstable (closes: #161569).
    - "octave2.1-headers | octave2.0-headers" have been added to
      Build-Depends, so that octave-plplot can be built from source
      (closes: 117708).
    - Packages build correctly on m68k (fixed in David's NMU,
      closes: #159807).
    - A problem in setting up octave2.1 has been fixed in Dirk
      Eddelbuettel's NMU (closes: #123700).
    - There is no plplot-bin package anymore.  Also, there is no
      dependency on nonexistent ghostscript package (closes: #136358).
    - The build failure due to a wrong Python directory has been fixed
      (closes:  #159811).
  * debian/control: Added warning message telling that the packages are
    experimental.
  * plplot-doc.prerm: Calling install-info with the correct number of
    arguments (closes: #182509).

 -- Rafael Laboissiere <rafael@debian.org>  Fri, 28 Feb 2003 18:52:55 +0100

plplot (5.2.0.cvs.20030227-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Built with new CVS sources.  Many DocBook related configuration
    problems have been fixed.
  * debian/rules: Added config-stamp creation to avoid double run of
    configure.  Run configure with --enable-docbook now.
  * debian/plplot-doc.prerm: Added file.

 -- Rafael Laboissiere <rafael@debian.org>  Thu, 27 Feb 2003 23:19:45 +0100

plplot (5.2.0.cvs.20030225-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Built with new CVS sources.  Some rpath problems have been fixed, so
    that the package is Lintian clean as regard the rpath.
  * Created new package plplot-tcl-dev.
  * debian/rules: Give option --without-rpath to configure.
  * debian/control: Removed dependencies on packages necessary for
    compiling the DocBook documentation, since they will be available in
    the upstream distribution tarball.

 -- Rafael Laboissiere <rafael@debian.org>  Tue, 25 Feb 2003 14:05:53 +0100

plplot (5.2.0.cvs.20030224-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Built with new CVS sources.  The info files and man pages are now
    included in the plplot-doc package.  There is also a new PLplot driver
    (mem).
  * debian/control: Added Build-Dependencies to Perl modules needed to
    generate the info form of documentation from the Docbook sources.
    Added build-dependency to libfreetype6-dev.  Added plplot-xwin
    dependency to plplot-tcl.
  * debian/plplot-doc.files: Added paths for info and man.
  * debian/rules: Give options --infodir and --with-freetype to
    configure.

 -- Rafael Laboissiere <rafael@debian.org>  Mon, 24 Feb 2003 16:36:52 +0100

plplot (5.2.0.cvs.20030219-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Built with new CVS sources.  The plplot_octave.oct file is installed
    in localoctfiledir, instead of octfiledir.  This avoids the versioned
    installation directory.
  * debian/control: octave-plplot does not depend anymore on a specific
    version of Octave.

 -- Rafael Laboissiere <rafael@debian.org>  Wed, 19 Feb 2003 12:06:33 +0100

plplot (5.2.0.cvs.20030218-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Something was strangely broken with the inclusion of files in the
    plplot-doc package, probably related to an extraneous config.cache
    file.  Fixed now.

 -- Rafael Laboissiere <rafael@debian.org>  Tue, 18 Feb 2003 21:37:44 +0100

plplot (5.2.0.cvs.20030218-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Built with new CVS sources, with improved installation of Octave files.

 -- Rafael Laboissiere <rafael@debian.org>  Tue, 18 Feb 2003 18:08:44 +0100

plplot (5.2.0.cvs.20030217-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Built with new CVS sources.
  * debian/rules:
    - Removed hacks for getting the Octave files correctly installed,
      since this is fixed in CVS now.
    - Added command to remove config.log and config.status files.  This
      makes lintian happy.
  * debian/octave-plplot.files: Included usr/share/doc/libplplot5/*.octave

 -- Rafael Laboissiere <rafael@debian.org>  Mon, 17 Feb 2003 18:34:29 +0100

plplot (5.2.0.cvs.20030214-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release, built directly from the CVS sources.
  * These packages are still experimental and are provided to help the
    preparation to the next upstream release (probably 5.2.1).
  * There has been a huge reorganization of the packages, thanks to the new
    dynamical loading of driver modules.  There has been too many changes to
    report here.

 -- Rafael Laboissiere <rafael@debian.org>  Tue, 16 Feb 2003 21:16:34 +0100

plplot (5.1.0-1.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Non-Maintainer Upload
  * Update for python-2.2 (Closes: #159807, #159811, #161569)
  # reenable plplot-python on all architectures
  * change Recommends: ghostscript (Closes: #136358)
  * Depend on autoconf-2.13, since scripts are broken for 2.50

 -- David Schleef <ds@schleef.org>  Fri, 11 Oct 2002 13:25:28 -0700

plplot (5.1.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Non-Maintainer Upload
  * New upstream version (Closes: #101264)
  * handle changing of name of libplmatrixd to libtclmatrixd.  Since
    this library is only used by libplplotd, it is not a ABI change.
    libtclmatrixd should probably be in a separate directory or linked
    directly with libplplotd -- this needs to be coordinated with
    upstream, and may also be moot once this packaged is changed to
    use loadable modules for the drivers.

 -- David Schleef <ds@schleef.org>  Thu, 15 Aug 2002 18:31:37 -0700

plplot (5.0.2-1.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * NMU
  * Fix hppa build problems. Closes: #141723
  * Remove 'potato' from version number.

 -- LaMont Jones <lamont@debian.org>  Sun,  7 Apr 2002 21:22:06 -0600

plplot (5.0.2-0.potato.3.2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Non-Maintainer Upload
  * debian/control, debian/rules: plplot indirectly Build-Depends
    on lapack to build python-plplot.  Since lapack is only available
    on a few architectures, this causes problems building the other
    packages on all architectures.  Fixed to Build-Depend and build
    python-plplot only on working architectures.

 -- David Schleef <ds@schleef.org>  Fri, 15 Mar 2002 20:49:18 -0500

plplot (5.0.2-0.potato.3.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Non-Maintainer Upload
  * Fix build dependencies (Closes: #92344, #98119, #102014)
  * cf/syslog.in: backport configure rules for tcl/itcl and python2.1
    (fixes new build problems)
  * debian/control: add dependencies to plplot-dev (Closes: #101392)
  * remove use of {} globbing in debian/rules (Closes: #101259)
  * debian/changelog: removed emacs settings
  * debian/control: change the tk/tcl build dependencies to 8.3
  * debian/*: update for python2.1
  * debian/control: fix python dependencies to coorespond to policy
  * debian/control: remove dependency on itk3.1, since it's added by
    ${shlibs:Depends}
  * debian/*.shlibs: Added shlibs files
    Note: the libplmatrix entry in plplot-tcl.shlibs specifies
    plplot-xwin, but plplot-xwin doesn't actually have the
    library.  This is ok, since it should only be used by
    libplplotd.so.
  * Fixed packages interdependencies and added ${shlibs:Depends}
    where appropriate
  * Fixed postinst, prerm scripts to use debhelper

 -- David Schleef <ds@schleef.org>  Sun, 17 Feb 2002 18:51:57 -0800

plplot (5.0.2-0.potato.3) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/control: Made plplot-common conflict and replace plplot <<
    5.0.2, because plplot-common took over plplot's FAQ file.  Thanks to
    Jim LewisMoss <dres@mindspring.com> (closes: #90846).
  * Removed some useless debian/*.dirs files, particularly
    plplot-tcl.dirs, which was creating a wrong directory
    /usr/lib/plplot5.0.1 (!).
  * Added more build dependencies, based on the buildd report on Sparc.
    Also, patched cf/sysloc.in to have configure finding the file tcl.h.
    Thanks to Ben Collins <bcollins@debian.org> (closes: #91228).

plplot (5.0.2-0.potato.2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Removed a extraneous file in the upstream directory.

plplot (5.0.2-0.potato.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * Backported patch from CVS for using fseek/ftell everywhere to
    eliminate non-portable behavior (closes: #86512).
  * Changes in the upstream configuration file for making the installation
    relocatable.  This will be hopefully integrated upstream in the next
    release of PLplot, and the Debian diff file will be reduced to files
    in the debian/ directory.
  * debian/plplot-doc.doc-base, debian/plplot-doc.files: Added files.
  * debian/plplot-doc.postinst: Added file for installing info files.
  * Added html, pdf, ps, and info forms of the PLplot manual to the
    plplot-doc package.
  * debian/plplot-dev.files: Added man pages generated from the DocBook
    API documentation.
  * debian/rules: Added commands for installing files into the plplot-doc
    and plplot-dev packages.
  * debian/control: Make plplot-doc conflict with plplot << 5.  This is
    because of the info files.
  * debian/plplot-*.README.Debian: Updated.

plplot (5.0.1-0.potato.5) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/control: Changed section of plplot-dev to devel (to avoid mail
    notification sent by dinstall, that overrides my choice).  Made
    plplot-tcl depend on iwidgets3.1 (which is needed to run example
    tk02).

 -- Rafael Laboissiere <rafael@icp.inpg.fr>  Mon, 19 Feb 2001 12:29:25 +0100

plplot (5.0.1-0.potato.4) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/rules: Excluding examples/ dir from list of compressible files
    by dh_compress.
    Make x16.py non-executable, since it is lacking the initial #! line.
    Give explicit -l options for dh_shlibdeps for packages plplot-tcl and
    plplot-xwin.  This will avoid the wrong dependencies that were being
    generated.
  * debian/control: Build-depends on iTcl.  This will make the plplot-tcl
    package [incr Tcl]-able.  This is needed to run the tk/tk01 and
    tk/tk04 examples (thanks to Alan Irwin <irwin@beluga.phys.uvic.ca> for
    pointing this out).  Also, made plplot-tcl depend on itk3.1.
  * examples/c/plcdemos.h: Removed #definition of PL_DOUBLE, as it is
    already done by plConfig.h.
  * cf/sysloc.in: Added /usr/include/itcl3.1/generic to incdirs_default.

plplot (5.0.1-0.potato.3) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/control: Make plplot-common conflict with older version of
    plplot.  This makes a smooth upgrade.

 -- Rafael Laboissiere <rafael@icp.inpg.fr>  Tue, 13 Feb 2001 12:53:09 +0100

plplot (5.0.1-0.potato.2) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/control: Better descriptions for plplot-c++ and plplot-common
    (thanks to Alan Irwin <irwin@beluga.phys.uvic.ca>).  Added "Replaces:"
    fields to plplot-xwin and plplot-tcl.  The dependencies now are
    simplified thanks to the use of a virtual package plplot-lib.
  * debian/plplot-doc.files: Removed file.
  * debian/plplot-dev.files: Addded usr/include.  This will put the header
    files into plplot-dev (thanks again to Alan).
  * Created new package plplot-bin with pltek, plpr and plm2gif, which
    were before in plplot-common.  This was causing circular dependency
    problems.
  * debian/plplot-common.files: Get some files that were wrongly going
    into the "empty" package plplot.

 -- Rafael Laboissiere <rafael@icp.inpg.fr>  Tue, 13 Feb 2001 12:21:20 +0100

plplot (5.0.1-0.potato.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.  Starting with version 5.0.0, PLplot entered a
    new development phase.  The project is now hosted at SourceForge
    (http://plplot.sourceforge.net) and the current Debian maintainer is
    also involved with upstream development.
  * This release works with potato (hence the release number).
  * There has been an overall reorganisation of the packages.  There is
    now a package called plplot-common, containing the data files.
    plplot-xwin and plplot-tcl are both exclusive and contain the shared
    libs.  plplot-c++ has the C++ bindings shared lib.  python-plplot is
    working with Python 1.5 and has been reintroduced.  plplot-doc is for
    now just a boilerplate package, waiting for the DocBook docs to be
    introduced in PLplot 5.0.2.
  * Prompt flush for pltcl is working now (closes: #58273).
  * debian/control:
    - Upgraded Standards-Version to 3.1.0.
    - Added Build-Depends.
    - Forced conflict between plplot and plplot-tcl packages.
    - New descriptions for packages plplot-dev and plplot-doc to reflect
      the fact that examples go into plplot-dev and plplot-doc is just a
      placeholder for future inclusion of the documentation in DocBook
      format.
    - Updated URL location of the PLplpot website.
    - Reintroduced entry for python-plplot.  Updated its dependency on
      plplot-tcl.
  * debian/postinst: Place "exit 0" at the right place, allowing debhelper
    added code to be executed (closes: #77997).  Also, removed code for
    installing info manual.  In the future, this will go in pakcage
    plplot-doc.
  * debian/rules: Major rewrite to reflect the new features of upstream
    build and install.  The main novelty here is the capability of
    doing make install with another $prefix than that used for building.
  * debian/*.{docs,files}: Heavily modified to reflect the new upstream
    version.
  * debian/control-python, debian/fix-tk-path.pl, debian/postrm,
    debian/python-exec-header, debian/python-plplot.postinst.debhelper,
    debian/python-plplot.prerm.debhelper: Removed files.
  * debian/plplot-980407-plplot-980407-new.patch: Removed this obsolete
    file.

plplot (4.99j-11) frozen unstable; urgency=low

  * Added --disable-linuxvga to configure options fixing an important bug
    report (closes: #65216).
  * The lib*tk files are moved to the right package now (plplot-tcl).
    This fixes the unnecessary dependency of the bare library package
    (plplot) on the TCl/Tk libraries.

 -- Rafael Laboissiere <rafael@icp.inpg.fr>  Wed,  7 Jun 2000 18:00:18 +0200

plplot (4.99j-10) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/rules:
    - Using option --without-f2c with ./configure.  This should avoid the
      build problems when the package f2c (which provides /usr/bin/fc) is
      installed (closes: #30944).
    - Erase empty dir usr/share/doc/examples after dh_movefiles.  This
      prevents the plplot from having junk in it.
  * debian/control: Excluded problematic package python-plplot.  Created
    file debian/control-pyhton for easy reversal in the future (closes:
    #33150).

 -- Rafael Laboissiere <rafael@icp.inpg.fr>  Mon,  8 Nov 1999 12:17:27 +0100

plplot (4.99j-9) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added "#define PLPLOT_DOUBLE" to plcdemos.h.  This will allow
    compilation of the examples, due to the lacking of `PLPLOT_DOUBLE'
    definition (Closes: #49120, #36993).  Also added a note in
    plplot-dev.README.Debian indicating how to compile correctly.
  * FHS compliant.
  * Upgraded to Standards-Version 3.0.1 (requires debhelper >= 2.0.68).
  * debian/copyright: Right location for the LGPL.
  * cf/sysconf.in: Added `SHLIB_F77FLAGS="-fpic -fPIC"'.

 -- Rafael Laboissiere <rafael@icp.inpg.fr>  Sat,  6 Nov 1999 21:01:13 +0100

plplot (4.99j-8) frozen unstable; urgency=low

  * Recompiled with new release of libc6 (cf discussion in debian-devel
    starting at
    http://www.debian.org/Lists-Archives/debian-devel-9812/msg00998.html).
  * Changed LDC in cf/sysconf.in to F77 (link with gcc complains because
    it is lacking symbols from g77).

 -- Rafael Laboissiere <rafael@icp.inpg.fr>  Fri, 11 Dec 1998 22:20:08 +0100

plplot (4.99j-7) frozen unstable; urgency=low

  * Set Conflicts relationship because files were moved around in the
    latest release (Fixes Bug#29694, reported by  Francesco Potorti`
    <F.Potorti@cnuce.cnr.it>).
  * Rebuilt to fix bogus dependency on tkstep8.0 (closes Bug#29704
    reported by Matthias Klose <doko@cs.tu-berlin.de>)

 -- Rafael Laboissiere <rafael@icp.inpg.fr>  Thu, 19 Nov 1998 16:33:24 +0100

plplot (4.99j-6) frozen unstable; urgency=low

  * Uploading to frozen and unstable.  (The previous release, 4.99j-5, was
    rejected and I never reuploaded it.)
  * Revamped debian/rules with use of variables for the debian dirs.
  * Corrected typo in plplot-dev.README (closes Bug#28534).
  * No compression of executable exemples in package plplot-doc.
  * Fixed paths only for tk* scripts under /usr/doc/plplot/examples/tk.
  * Fixed permission for plcolor.tcl and tkdemos.tcl.
  * Fixed path for script x16.py (in plplot-doc).
  * Moved library files libMatrix and libplplotdtk from plplot-tcl to
    plplot.
  * Moved info file from the plplot-doc package to the base package
    plplot: this is the only documentation availalbe for the PLplot API.
  * Fixed typo ("\*") in debhelper compress files.
  * Fixed the problem related to the naming of shared libraries.
  * Improved "Description:" fields in debian/control:
    - Added "a scientific library" to first line (as suggested by
      Christopher J. Fearnley <cjf@I21.com>).
    - Included URL of PLplot homepage for each package.
  * dh_shlibdeps does not act on package python-plplot.
  * postinst and postrm test now for its argument.
  * Rewrote README.Debian files.

plplot (4.99j-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Build with patch from Joao Cardoso <jcardoso@inescn.pt> for Octave
    interface.  The patch file is included in the debian/ directory.
  * The orig.tar.gz and the diff.gz files were absent from 4.99j-4
    upload.  This is corrected now (bug reported by Paul Slootman
    <paul@wau.mis.ah.nl>).
  * Corrected sed expression for fixing the #! path in Python scripts
  * Corrected bug in debian/compress file which was causing compression of
    executable scripts under usr/doc/plplot/examples.
  * Created plplot-tcl.postinst with a call to ldconfig, as plplot-tcl
    includes shared libraries.
  * Links to the shared library are now Policy compliant, i.e. their names
    have only one number after .so.
  * debian/shlibs.local is renamed to debian/shlibs, and
    debian/plplot-tcl.shlibs is created.
  * The scripts installed under usr/lib/tcl8.0/plplot/ should not be
    executable.

plplot (4.99j-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/fix-tk-path.pl script is chmod'd in debian/rules files: now
    fixes really first part of Bug#26935.  Fix suggested by Paul Slootman
    <paul@wau.mis.ah.nl>.
  * debian/control: plplot-doc architecture is now "all" and is compiled
    in the binary-indep section of debian/rules (suggested by
    Paul Slootman <paul@wau.mis.ah.nl>).  In order to do that, big changes
    in debian/rules were done.  Hope I did not screw things up.
  * debian/rules: Corrected hideous bug in chmod mode switches: "chmod -x"
    should be "chmod +x".
  * Corrected some typos in debian/control, debian/copyright.
  * cf/pkg_tcl.in: put number version in libMatrix.so (changed
    README.Debian to document the fix).
  * Moved libMatrix.so and libMatrix.a to plplot-dev package.
  * Moved libMatrix.so.* and libplplotdtk.so.* to plplot-tcl package, and
    made plplot-dev depend on plplot-tcl (changed debian/control file to
    reflect the changes).
  * I just realized that the upstream Python support works only with
    python-1.4.  I will fix this in the next release.

plplot (4.99j-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/rules: fixing Python path for python scripts is done now with a
    sed command (get rid of debian/fix-python-path.pl).  Suggested by
    Matthias Klose <doko@cs.tu-berlin.de>.
  * Change in upstream file utils/pltek.c: gcc 2.7.2.3 deprecates the use
    of gets
  * Corrected file debian/plplot-dev.files, in order to have the files
    libMatrix.* included in the right package (plplot).
  * Make plplot conflict with plplot-dev for versions previous to this
    one, because of the move of libMatrix.*.
  * Changed mode of debian/fix-tk-path.pl script to executable (fixes
    first part of Bug#26935).
  * Building is now done entirely under debian/tmp (fixes second part of
    Bug#26935).
  * Buildning now `with double' instead of `with float', as required for
    the PLplot Octave interface.  Also, all instances of `libplotf*' were
    changed to `libplotd*' (in debian/rules and in debian/*.files).
  * /usr/lib/libplplotdtk.so.* files moved to the plplot package (they were
    in plplot-tcl): this fixes the problem of installing the plplot-dev
    package with a dangling symlink.
  * Removed file debian/dirs, which had no function at all.
  * Tcl/Tk and Python scripts under /usr/doc/plplot/examples are now
    executable.
  * fix-tk-path.pl: corrected "/example/" -> "/examples/"

plplot (4.99j-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Using debhelper 0.93 : README.Debian files are installed automatically
    by dh_installdocs
  * Fixed some problems found by Matthias Klose <doko@cs.tu-berlin.de>.
    Danke Matthias!
  * Corrected typo in fix-pytho-path.pl, that made all python examples
    have size equal to zero.
  * examples/Makefile has now correct references to /usr directories
  * Scripts under /usr/doc/plplot/examples are no more compressed
  * Tk scripts under /usr/doc/examples/tk have now the right path after
    `#!'
  * Added dependency python-tk to python-plplot
