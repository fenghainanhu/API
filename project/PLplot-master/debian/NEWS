plplot (5.9.8-1) unstable; urgency=low

    New libplplot-ocaml, libplplot-lua and libplplot-d packages have been 
    introduced. These contain the PLplot bindings for the ocaml, lua and D
    languages respectively. 

    New python-plplot-qt package has been introduced which allows the PLplot
    API to be used in Qt applications from python using pyqt4.

plplot (5.9.6-1) unstable; urgency=low

    The plplot-bin package has been dropped since all the utilities in contained
    were now obsolete, or relied on obsolete drivers.

    A new plplot9-driver-qt package has been introduced for the new qt driver
    and bindings. This produce high quality interactive output on multiple 
    platforms (Linux / Mac OS-X / Windows) as well as a range of file formats
    including postscript, pdf, svg, png, jpeg and ppm. Upstream the gd driver is
    now disabled by default and the qt or cairo are recommended instead. In a
    subsequent release it is likely that the Debian package of the gd driver will
    also be dropped and so it is recommended that you move to the qt or cairo 
    drivers instead.
