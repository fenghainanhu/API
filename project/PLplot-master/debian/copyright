Comment: The intent behind distributing PLplot under the LGPL is to ensure that it
 continues to evolve in a positive way, while remaining freely
 distributable.  The package is considered a "library" even though there
 are associated programs, such as plrender, pltek, plserver, and pltcl.
 The ties between these programs and the library are so great that I
 consider them as part of the library, so distribution under the terms of
 the LGPL makes sense.  Software developers are allowed and encouraged to
 use PLplot as an integral part of their product, even a commercial
 product.  Under the conditions of the LGPL, however, the PLplot source
 code must remain freely available, including any modifications you make to
 it (if you distribute a program based on the modified library).  Please
 read the full license for more info.

Comment: The octave front end which links to the PLplot library (but not 
 vice versa), and which is otherwise independent of PLplot is copyright 
 under the GPL license (see COPYING).
